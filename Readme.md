##&lt;gfs-checkout&gt;##

The `gfs-checkout` widget provides a rich user interface that interacts with the GFS Checkout service in order to provide a wide range of easily configured delivery options. If it's place on the same page as the Carrier Information, Selected Drop Point and/or Delivery Address widgets, the Checkout widget will also assume control of them.

```html
<gfs-checkout
	initial-address="50 Mill Way, Southampton, SO40 7JF, United Kingdom"
	currency-symbol="&pound;">
</gfs-checkout>
```
